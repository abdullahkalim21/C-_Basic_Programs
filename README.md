# C-_Basic_Programs
Every Program is commented so it's upto to you that which program you want to use. So Remove the multi-line comments' signs from the program that you want to use
OR
You can copy the program code and run it in your own file (I'll recommend you to copy the code to not get into more complications)

P.S.
These are the basic programs that I ahve done learning C++ language. Any future changes & programs that I'll perform will be available here with source code.
