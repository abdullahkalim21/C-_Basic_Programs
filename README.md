# C++ Basic Programs
Every file has different kinds of small programs and there's a **_Table of Contents_** in each file that will tell you which program is written in the respective file.
Copy the code and run it in your file/add it to your project.<br/>
**_P.S._**
These are the basic programs that I have done while learning C++ language. Any future changes & programs that I'll perform will be available here with the source code.
_Every file has a copy of it with same name with .md extension
Like app.cpp has a same file's content as app.md but in .md file you can find programs easily with proper links attatched_
