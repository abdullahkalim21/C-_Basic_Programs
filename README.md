# cpp_Basic_Programs
app.cpp is the main file & contains the source code.
Every Program is commented so it's up to you which program you want to use. So Remove the multi-line comments signs from the program that you want to use
OR
You can copy the program code and run it in your own file (I'll recommend you copy the code to not get into more complications)

P.S.
These are the basic programs that I have done in learning C++ language. Any future changes & programs that I'll perform will be available here with the source code.
